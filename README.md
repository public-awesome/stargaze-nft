# Stargaze Tools V2

Stargaze Tools is a set of tools to interact with Launchpad smart contracts on Stargaze.

It's designed for creators and developers to help launch and manage collections. As use cases grow, more tools and scripts will be added.

## Setup project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/public-awesome/stargaze-tools
cd stargaze-tools
yarn install
```

## Create an account on testnet

```sh
yarn account
```

This outputs an address you can use to instantiate your minter contract.

## Get funds from faucet

Ask for funds from the `#faucet` channel in [Discord Stargaze](https://discord.gg/stargaze).

```
$request [address]
```

## Configure project

Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`.
Edit `config.js` with your project configuration.

## Vending Minter

A vending minter is suitable for PFP-style 10,000 item or less generative collections.

### Initialize a vending minter contract

A minter is created from a factory contract.

```sh
yarn minter
```

Creating an updatable vending collection requires adding --updatable-vending to the above command.

```sh
yarn minter --updatable-vending
```

### Mint

#### Mint a specific NFT to an address

```sh
yarn mint --for [token_id] [address]
```

`[address]` can be any Cosmos address. It'll be converted automatically into a Stargaze address.

#### Mint to an address

```sh
yarn mint --to [address]
```

This mints the next available token ID to the given address.

#### Batch mint

Mint `num` NFTs to an address.

```sh
yarn mint --to [address] --batch [num]
```

Same as `mint --to` but mints the next [num] tokens sequentially to the given address.

#### Batch update token URIs

**Only available for updatable collections.**

```sh
yarn update-metadata

```

Update a single token's metadata

```
yarn update-metadata 1 ipfs://somethinghere
```

### Whitelist (optional)

Instantiate a whitelist contract:

```sh
yarn whitelist
```

The output of the above command should give you a whitelist contract address. Edit `config.js` and update the `whitelist` field with this value. Next, set this address in your minter contract with:

```sh
yarn minter --whitelist [whitelist_address]
```

To add addresses to the whitelist, use:

```sh
yarn whitelist --add [stars1..., stars2..., etc.]
```

## Base Minter (1/1s)

A base minter is suitable for collections of 1/1s.

### Initialize a base minter contract

A minter is created from a factory contract.

```sh
yarn base-minter
```

### Mint

```sh
yarn mint --token-uri [token-uri]
```

## Open Edition Minter

Open edition minter allows multiple copies of a single NFT to be minted for a given time interval.

### Initialize an open edition minter contract
Specify the collection info and open edition minter configuration in `config.js`, then run:
```sh
yarn open-edition-minter
```
The user is prompted to choose whether the metadata will be stored off-chain or on-chain. 
- **off-chain**: the metadata needs to be uploaded to IPFS beforehand and the URI should be specified as _tokenUri_ in `config.js/openEditionMinterConfig`
- **on-chain**: the metadata will be stored on-chain upon collection creation and should be specified as _metadata_ in `config.js/openEditionMinterConfig`
### Mint
#### Mint a token to an address
Specify the minter contract address in `config.js` and run:
```sh
yarn mint --to [address]
```
This mints a token to the given address.
#### Batch mint tokens to an address
Mint `num` tokens to an address.

```sh
yarn mint --to [address] --batch [num]
```
#### Update trading start time
Specify the new `startTradingTime` in `config.js/openEditionMinterConfig` and run:
```sh
yarn open-edition-minter --update-start-trading-time
```
#### Update per address limit
Specify the new `perAddressLimit` in `config.js/openEditionMinterConfig` and run:
```sh
yarn open-edition-minter --update-per-address-limit
```
## Query sg721

You can run queries against an instantiated sg721 contract with:

```sh
yarn query
```

For all possible queries, see the [query types](https://github.com/public-awesome/cw-nfts/blob/main/contracts/cw721-base/src/msg.rs#L76).

## Transfer NFT
You can transfer your nft to another address with:

```sh
yarn transfer-nft [sg721_address] [token_id] [recipient_address]
```

## SG-721 Batch Transfer
You can batch transfer tokens from a file. Copy `transfer.example.csv` to `transfer.csv` and configure for recipients and their `token_id`. Then use the following command:
```sh
yarn transfer-file
```

## Splits (optional)

Splits allow splitting mint revenue and secondary sale royalties across multiple accounts.

Define split members and allocations in `config.js`, and run:

```sh
yarn group
```

This command will output the group contract address. Now use this address to create a splits contract:

```sh
yarn splits [group-address]
```

Now the address of the splits contract can be used for the `paymentAddress` (primary sales) and/or `royaltyPaymentAddress` (secondary sales) in `config.js` when creating a minter.


To distribute funds from the splits contract(defined in `config.js`), make sure you are either the `admin` or a member of the group, and run:

```sh
yarn distribute-splits
```

## Query Splits
This command will query the splits contract. 
```sh
yarn query-splits <query-type>
```
### Possible query types:
- **member** [member-address] | |
*Query a member of the group with given address*
- **group** | |
*Query the group contract*
- **list-members** | |
*Query all members of the group*
- **admin** | |
*Query the admin of the group*

## Snapshot

Create a snapshot of owners of a vending collection:

```
yarn vending-snapshot [collection] [expected_num_tokens]
```

For example, to do a snapshot of all owners of Bad Kids:

```
yarn vending-snapshot stars19jq6mj84cnt9p7sagjxqf8hxtczwc8wlpuwe4sh62w45aheseues57n420 9999
```

This generates a CSV file called `snapshot.csv`. Burned tokens will show as `burned` for the owner address.

### Snapshot + Airdrop

You can airdrop a new collection to owners of an existing vending collection.

First configure a new minter following [instructions above](#configure-project).

Then generate a snapshot. For example, to airdrop a new collection to owners of Bad Kids:

```
yarn vending-snapshot stars19jq6mj84cnt9p7sagjxqf8hxtczwc8wlpuwe4sh62w45aheseues57n420 9999
```

Then Airdrop to each address in the snapshot:

```
yarn mint-for-file
```

_Note: Burned tokens will be minted to your account._

### Flexible Whitelist

Use a whitelist that has custom `per_address_limit` based on NFT ownership of a different collection. This requires using the flexible factory address, flexible minter code id, and flexible whitelist code id.

```sh
yarn minter --flex-vending
yarn vending-snapshot
yarn query-owner-nft-count
# creates owner-nft-count.csv with the number of NFTs owned by each address
yarn whitelist-flex
yarn whitelist-flex-file
yarn minter --whitelist [whitelist_address]
```

## Testnet

Test your contract. Make sure it's visible in launchpad. Try minting and viewing the NFT in your profile.
